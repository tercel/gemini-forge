# Scaffold Project — Sub-agent Prompt Template

Variables to fill: `{target-repo-name}`, `{target-path}`, `{lang}`, `{type}`, `{tech_stack}`, `{package_name}`, `{api_contract}`, `{ref_path}`, `{conventions_path}`

---

Create the project skeleton for {target-repo-name} at {target-path}.

Language: {lang}
Type: {type}
Tech stack: {tech_stack decisions}
Package name: {package_name}

## Project Structure — Derived from Reference

The API contract (below) contains a SOURCE_TREE, TESTS, and EXAMPLES section discovered from the reference implementation. Use these to drive the scaffold:

1. **src/** — Mirror the SOURCE_TREE structure, translating each file and directory to {lang} idioms:
   - Convert file extensions to {lang} equivalent
   - Apply {lang} naming conventions (see Naming section below)
   - Each source file becomes a stub with correct signatures from MODULES

2. **tests/** — Mirror the TESTS structure from the API contract:
   - Create one test file per source module using {lang} test naming convention
   - Preserve all subdirectories from the reference test tree
   - Each test file is a failing stub (TDD red phase)

3. **examples/** — Mirror the EXAMPLES structure from the API contract (if present):
   - Port each example to {lang} with complete, runnable code
   - Preserve the directory structure
   - If the reference has no examples/, skip this directory

4. **Project boilerplate:**
   - {build-config} (pyproject.toml / package.json / go.mod / Cargo.toml / pom.xml / etc.)
   - .gitignore (language-appropriate patterns)
   - README.md (project name, description, installation, link to docs)
   - CHANGELOG.md (empty "## [Unreleased]" section)
   - LICENSE (detect from existing ecosystem repos or ask user)

## Stub File Content

**Source stubs** — each file should contain:
1. Module/file header comment referencing the protocol spec section
2. Import of base types from the main module
3. Class/function stubs with correct signatures from the API contract
4. TODO comments indicating what needs to be implemented
5. Type annotations matching the language convention

**Test stubs** — each test file should contain:
1. Import of the module under test and test framework
2. One test class/describe block per public class or function group
3. One failing stub test per public method: asserts `False` / `expect(false)` / `t.Fatal("not implemented")` — TDD red phase
4. Helper file (conftest.py / helpers.ts) with shared fixtures: mock executor, sample context, sample module config
5. Integration test directory with at least one placeholder test for end-to-end flow

**Example files** — each example should contain:
1. Complete, runnable code (not stubs) that demonstrates one usage pattern
2. Inline comments explaining each step
3. Port examples from the reference implementation, adapting to target language idioms

## Reference Sync

Read examples and tests from the reference implementation at {ref_path}:

1. **Examples**: Read `{ref_path}/examples/` — port each example file to {lang}, preserving the same usage patterns and directory structure. Adapt naming conventions and idioms to the target language.
2. **Tests**: Read `{ref_path}/tests/` — create corresponding test stubs for every test file. Do NOT copy test logic; instead create failing stubs (TDD red phase) that mirror the reference test structure and coverage scope. Preserve all subdirectory organization.
3. If the reference has no examples/ or tests/ directory, fall back to the API contract to generate them from scratch.

## API Contract Reference
{api_contract}

## Naming

Read the naming conventions file at `{conventions_path}` for the authoritative code naming and test file naming rules. Key points for {lang}:

**Code naming:** Apply {lang}'s idiomatic casing to all canonical API names (see "Code naming" table in conventions).

**Test file naming per language:**
- Python: `test_{module}.py` (pytest discovery)
- TypeScript: `{module}.test.ts` (vitest discovery)
- Go: `{module}_test.go` (go test discovery)
- Rust: `test_{module}.rs` in tests/ for integration tests; also add `#[cfg(test)] mod tests {}` blocks in source files for unit tests
- Java: `{Module}Test.java` with `@Test` methods named `shouldDoX()`
- C#: `{Module}Tests.cs` with `[Fact]` or `[Test]` methods
- Kotlin: `{Module}Test.kt`
- Swift: `{Module}Tests.swift`
- PHP: `{Module}Test.php`

## Error Handling

- If {target-path} is not writable, return: STATUS: WRITE_ERROR, REASON: "{description}"
- If a file cannot be created, skip it and include in the return as "{file} (SKIPPED: {reason})"
- If the language is not recognized, return: STATUS: UNSUPPORTED_LANG, REASON: "No scaffold template for {lang}"

Create ALL files. Return the list of files created.
