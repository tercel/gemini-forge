# Apcore Skills — Audit

Comprehensive consistency audit across all apcore ecosystem repositories.

## Iron Law

**AUDIT EVERY DIMENSION. CLASSIFY EVERY FINDING. A partial audit creates false confidence.**

## When to Use

- Before a major release to ensure ecosystem-wide consistency
- After adding a new SDK or integration to verify alignment
- Periodic health check (monthly recommended)
- When suspecting drift between implementations

## Command Format

```
/apcore-skills:audit [--scope core|mcp|integrations|all] [--fix] [--save report.md]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--scope` | **cwd** | Which repo group to audit. **If omitted, defaults to the current working directory's repo only.** Use `--scope all` for full ecosystem audit. |
| `--fix` | off | Auto-fix issues where safe |
| `--save` | off | Save report to file |

## Audit Dimensions

The audit covers 8 dimensions, each checking specific aspects:

| # | Dimension | Severity Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | API Surface | critical-warning | Public API alignment across languages |
| D2 | Naming Conventions | critical-warning | File/class/function naming per language rules |
| D3 | Version Sync | critical-info | Version alignment within sync groups |
| D4 | Documentation | warning-info | README, CHANGELOG, docstring completeness |
| D5 | Test Coverage | warning-info | Test file existence and coverage metrics |
| D6 | Dependencies | critical-warning | Dependency versions and compatibility |
| D7 | Configuration | warning-info | APCORE_* settings consistency across integrations |
| D8 | Project Structure | warning-info | File/directory layout per conventions |

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | Breaking inconsistency — users will hit errors | Must fix before release |
| `warning` | Non-breaking inconsistency — confusing but functional | Should fix soon |
| `info` | Cosmetic or minor inconsistency | Nice to fix |

## Context Management

**All dimension audits and per-repo fixes are executed by parallel sub-agents.** The main context ONLY handles:
1. Orchestration — determining scope and spawning sub-agents
2. Aggregation — collecting structured findings from all sub-agents
3. Reporting — formatting and displaying the consolidated report

Step 2 spawns **up to 8 parallel sub-agents** (one per dimension, all simultaneously). Step 4 spawns **one parallel sub-agent per repo** for fixes. The main context never reads repo files directly.

## Workflow

```
Step 0 (ecosystem) → Step 1 (parse args) → Step 2 (parallel audits) → Step 3 (report) → [Step 4 (fix)]
```

## Detailed Steps

### Step 0: Ecosystem Discovery

@../shared/ecosystem.md

---

### Step 1: Parse Arguments and Plan Audit

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for flags.

#### 1.1 CWD-based Default Scope

**If `--scope` is NOT specified:**
1. Detect CWD repo name (basename of CWD)
2. Look up in discovered ecosystem:
   - `core-sdk` repo → audit only this repo, dimensions D1-D3, D5-D6, D8
   - `mcp-bridge` repo → audit only this repo, dimensions D1-D3, D5-D6, D8
   - `integration` repo → audit only this repo, dimensions D2-D8
   - `protocol`/`docs-site` repo → audit documentation dimensions only (D4) for this repo
   - `shared-lib`/`tooling` repo → audit D2 (naming), D4 (docs), D5 (tests), D8 (structure) for this repo
   - CWD not an apcore repo → use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "CWD is not an apcore repo. Which repo do you want to audit?" with options from `repos[]` names + "All repos (full ecosystem audit)"
3. Display: "Scope: {repo-name} (from CWD). Use --scope all for full ecosystem audit."

**If `--scope` IS specified:** use explicit scope.

#### 1.2 Scope → Repos & Dimensions

| Scope | Repos | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Core SDKs | D1-D3, D5-D6, D8 |
| `mcp` | MCP bridges | D1-D3, D5-D6, D8 |
| `integrations` | Framework integrations | D2-D8 (no cross-API sync) |
| `all` | All repos | All dimensions |

Display:
```
Audit scope: {scope} {("(from CWD)" if defaulted)}
Repos: {count} repositories
Dimensions: {list}
```

---

### Step 2: Execute Audit Dimensions (Sub-agents)

Spawn **all dimension sub-agents in parallel (up to 8 simultaneously)**. Each sub-agent audits exactly 1 dimension. All dimensions are fully independent — no batching or serialization needed.

#### Sub-agent: D1 — API Surface Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit API surface consistency across apcore SDK implementations.

Repos to compare: {repo_paths}

For each repo:
1. Read the main export file (__init__.py / index.ts)
2. Count total exports
3. Categorize: classes, functions, types, enums, constants, errors
4. For each class: list constructor params and public method names

Compare across repos:
- Missing symbols (in one, not the other)
- Method count mismatches per class
- Constructor param count mismatches

Return findings in format:
Error handling:
- If a repo path does not exist, skip it and report as: severity=warning, detail="Repo not found at {path}"
- If main export file is missing, report as: severity=warning, detail="No exports found in {repo}"

DIMENSION: D1 — API Surface
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file:line if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
```

#### Sub-agent: D2 — Naming Conventions Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit naming conventions across apcore ecosystem repos.

Repos: {repo_paths}

Check against conventions:
- Python: snake_case files, snake_case functions, PascalCase classes
- TypeScript: kebab-case files, camelCase functions, PascalCase classes
- Package names match convention (snake_case for Python, kebab-case for npm)
- Error class names end with "Error"
- Enum names are PascalCase, enum values are UPPER_SNAKE

Scan all source files in each repo:
1. Check filenames in src/ directory
2. Grep for class/function definitions and verify naming
3. Check import/export names in main module file
4. Verify error classes follow naming pattern

Error handling: If a repo path does not exist or has no src/ directory, report as:
- severity: info, detail: "Repo {name} has no source files to audit"

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D2 — Naming Conventions
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file:line if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
```

#### Sub-agent: D3 — Version Sync Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit version synchronization across apcore ecosystem.

Repos: {repo_paths with types}

Check:
1. Core SDK versions must match (major.minor): {core repos}
2. MCP bridge versions must match (major.minor): {mcp repos}
3. Within each repo, version must be consistent across all version files
   - Python: pyproject.toml version == __init__.py __version__
   - TypeScript: package.json version == src/index.ts VERSION (if present)
4. Integration repos: dependency versions reference compatible core SDK versions

Error handling: If a build config file is missing or malformed, report as a warning finding rather than failing.

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D3 — Version Sync
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file:line if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
```

#### Sub-agent: D4 — Documentation Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit documentation quality across apcore ecosystem.

Repos: {repo_paths}

For each repo check:
1. README.md exists and contains: description, installation, quick start, link to docs
2. CHANGELOG.md exists and follows Keep a Changelog format
3. LICENSE file exists
4. Key source files have docstrings/JSDoc
5. Public API methods have parameter documentation
6. Examples directory exists (for integrations)

Error handling: If a repo path does not exist, skip it and report as info finding.

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D4 — Documentation
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
```

#### Sub-agent: D5 — Test Coverage Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit test coverage across apcore ecosystem.

Repos: {repo_paths}

For each repo:
1. Check tests/ directory exists
2. Count test files
3. Map source files to test files (check for coverage gaps)
4. Run test suite and capture results (detect language from build config, check runner availability first):
   - Python: `pytest --tb=short -q`
   - TypeScript: `npx vitest run`
   - Go: `go test -cover ./...`
   - Rust: `cargo test`
   - Java (Maven): `mvn test -q`
   - Java (Gradle): `gradle test`
   - C#: `dotnet test`
   - Swift: `swift test`
   - PHP: `vendor/bin/phpunit`
   - Elixir: `mix test`
   If the test runner is not available, report as a finding instead of running.
5. If coverage tool available, capture coverage percentage

Error handling:
- If dependencies are not installed (import errors, module not found), report as: severity=warning, detail="Test dependencies not installed for {repo}"
- If test runner is not found, report as: severity=warning, detail="Test runner not available for {repo}"
- Do NOT fail the entire audit if one repo's tests can't run

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D5 — Test Coverage
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
TEST_RESULTS:
- repo: {repo-name}
  status: {pass|fail|skipped}
  total: {N}
  passed: {N}
  failed: {N}
  coverage: {pct or "unknown"}
```

#### Sub-agent: D6 — Dependencies Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit dependency alignment across apcore ecosystem.

Repos: {repo_paths}

Check:
1. Core SDK dependencies: schema validation lib versions match expectations
2. MCP bridge dependencies: MCP SDK versions are compatible
3. Integration dependencies: core SDK version references are up-to-date
4. No duplicate dependencies with different versions across repos
5. Dev dependencies include linter (ruff/eslint), type checker (mypy/tsc), test framework
6. No known vulnerability patterns in pinned versions

Error handling: If a build config file is missing, report as: severity=warning, detail="No build config found for {repo}"

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D6 — Dependencies
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file:line if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
```

#### Sub-agent: D7 — Configuration Audit (integrations only)

**Prompt:**
```
Audit APCORE_* configuration consistency across framework integrations.

Repos: {integration_repo_paths}

For each integration:
1. Read config.py/config.ts — search in src/{package}/ directory
2. Extract all APCORE_* settings with types and defaults
3. Compare settings across integrations — same settings should have same types and defaults

Required settings (must be present in all):
- APCORE_ENABLED, APCORE_DEBUG, APCORE_SCANNERS
- APCORE_INCLUDE_PATHS, APCORE_EXCLUDE_PATHS
- APCORE_MODULE_PREFIX, APCORE_AUTH_ENABLED
- APCORE_TRANSPORT, APCORE_HOST, APCORE_PORT

Error handling: If config file not found in a repo, report as: severity=warning, detail="Config file not found for {repo}"

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D7 — Configuration
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {file:line if applicable}
  fix: {suggested fix}
CONFIG_MATRIX:
- setting: {APCORE_SETTING}
  {repo-1}: {type}={default}
  {repo-2}: {type}={default}
  consistent: true|false

Target ~2-3KB. If more than 20 settings exist, only list inconsistent settings in the matrix and summarize consistent ones as a count.
```

#### Sub-agent: D8 — Project Structure Audit

**Prompt:**
```
Audit project structure consistency across apcore ecosystem.

Repos: {repo_paths}

Check against conventions:
- Core SDKs: has src/ with expected subdirectories (middleware/, registry/, schema/, observability/, utils/)
- MCP bridges: has src/ with expected subdirectories (server/, auth/, adapters/, converters/)
- Integrations: has src/ with expected structure (scanners/, output/, cli)
- All repos: has tests/, .gitignore, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, build config

Error handling: If a repo directory does not exist or is empty, report as: severity=info, detail="Repo {name} is empty or placeholder"

Return findings in this exact format:
DIMENSION: D8 — Project Structure
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
FINDINGS:
- severity: {critical|warning|info}
  repo: {repo-name}
  detail: {description}
  location: {directory or file}
  fix: {suggested fix}
```

### Step 4: Auto-Fix (only with --fix flag)

Group fixable findings by repo. Separate unfixable findings for reporting.

**Unfixable (skip and report):**
- API surface fixes (complex — delegate to `/apcore-skills:sync --phase a --fix`)
- Dependency fixes (risky — show as recommendations only)

**Fixable (per-repo parallel sub-agents):**

Spawn one `Task(subagent_type="general-purpose")` **per repo that has fixable findings, all in parallel**:

**Sub-agent prompt:**
```
Apply audit fixes for {repo_path}.

Fixable findings:
{all fixable findings for this repo from Step 3}

Fix rules (apply in order):
1. NAMING FIXES (D2) — Rename files/symbols to match conventions
2. VERSION FIXES (D3) — Update version strings for consistency
3. STRUCTURE FIXES (D8) — Create missing directories/files with stubs
4. DOC FIXES (D4) — Add missing README sections, fix CHANGELOG format

After all fixes:
- Run the full test suite (detect language: pytest | npx vitest run | go test ./... | cargo test | mvn test | gradle test | dotnet test | swift test | vendor/bin/phpunit | mix test)
- If tests fail: identify which fix caused it, revert ONLY that fix
- Leave all changes uncommitted

Error handling: If test runner is not available, skip verification and note it.

Return:
REPO: {repo-name}
FIXES_APPLIED: {count}
FIXES_REVERTED: {count}
TEST_RESULT: {pass|fail|skipped}
TEST_COUNTS: {passed}/{total}
CHANGES:
- dimension: {D2|D3|D4|D8}
  file: {path}
  action: {what was changed}
```

Wait for all repo fix sub-agents to complete.

Display consolidated results:
```
Auto-fix applied:
  {repo-1}: {N} fixes (naming: 2, version: 1, structure: 0, docs: 1)
  {repo-2}: {N} fixes (naming: 0, version: 1, structure: 2, docs: 0)

Tests after fix:
  {repo-1}: {pass}/{total} passing ✓
  {repo-2}: {pass}/{total} passing ✓

Unfixed (manual action needed):
  [D1-001] API surface gap — use /apcore-skills:sync --phase a --fix
  [D4-xxx] Doc inconsistency — use /apcore-skills:sync --phase b for deep check
  [D6-002] Dependency version — manually update {package}

Review changes:
  cd {repo-1} && git diff
  cd {repo-2} && git diff
```
