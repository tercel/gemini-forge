# Apcore Skills — Integration

## ⚡ Execution Entry Point (READ THIS FIRST)

**When this skill is loaded, you MUST immediately begin executing the Workflow below — do not wait, do not summarize, do not ask "what should I do now". Skills are operational manuals, not reference documents.** read_file the first executable step, perform it, then the next, etc., until the workflow completes or you reach an `ask_user` checkpoint.

If the harness shows you `Successfully loaded skill · N tools allowed`, that message means **the SKILL.md content was injected into your context** — it does NOT mean the skill has run. Skills do not "run" autonomously; you run them by executing the Detailed Steps below.

If you find yourself about to say "the skill didn't produce output", "skill 仍未输出", "falling back to manual bootstrap", "回退到手动 integration", or anything similar, **STOP**. You have misunderstood how skills work. Go directly to the first executable step and start.

The first user-visible action of this skill should be either (a) the output of the first step, or (b) an `ask_user` if the first step needs disambiguation. Never an apology, never a fallback, never silence.

Bootstrap a new framework integration that connects a web framework to the apcore ecosystem.

## Iron Law

**EVERY INTEGRATION MUST IMPLEMENT THE SAME 5 CORE CAPABILITIES: scan endpoints, register modules, map request context, serve via MCP, and export to OpenAI tools format.**

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This framework is different, it needs a different approach" | The 5 core capabilities are the same. Only the framework-specific adapters differ. |
| "I'll skip the demo project" | Demo projects are how users evaluate integrations. Always include one. |
| "CLI commands can come later" | CLI is the primary UX. `scan` and `serve` commands are required from day one. |
| "I'll just wrap the core SDK directly" | Integrations must use apcore-discovery for scanner logic to ensure consistency. |

## When to Use

- Creating a new framework integration (e.g., `fastapi-apcore`, `express-apcore`, `gin-apcore`)
- Re-scaffolding an existing integration that needs restructuring
- Evaluating what's needed for a new framework integration

## Command Format

```
/apcore-skills:integration <framework> [--lang python|typescript|go] [--ref django-apcore]
```

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `<framework>` | Yes | — | Target framework: `fastapi`, `express`, `gin`, `spring`, `actix`, etc. |
| `--lang` | No | auto-detect | Language of the framework |
| `--ref` | No | auto-detect | Reference integration to learn patterns from |

## 5 Core Capabilities

Every apcore framework integration must provide:

| # | Capability | Description | CLI Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Endpoint Scanner** | Discover framework routes and convert to apcore module definitions | `{framework} apcore scan` |
| 2 | **Module Registry** | Register scanned endpoints as apcore modules with metadata | (automatic) |
| 3 | **Context Mapping** | Map framework request objects to apcore `Context` | (automatic) |
| 4 | **MCP Server** | Start an MCP server exposing registered modules as tools | `{framework} apcore serve` |
| 5 | **OpenAI Export** | Export registered modules as OpenAI-compatible tool definitions | `{framework} apcore export` |

## Context Management

Steps 2 and 4 use sub-agents. Step 2 analyzes the reference integration. Step 4 generates the project skeleton. Main context retains only structured summaries.

## Workflow

```
Step 0 (ecosystem) → 1 (parse args) → 2 (analyze reference) → 3 (framework research) → 4 (scaffold) → 5 (demo project) → 6 (plan) → 7 (summary)
```

## Detailed Steps

### Step 0: Ecosystem Discovery

@../references/shared/ecosystem.md

---

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. Extract `<framework>` — required, use `ask_user` if missing
2. Extract `--lang` — auto-detect from framework:
   - Python frameworks: `fastapi`, `flask`, `django`, `starlette`, `falcon`, `tornado`
   - TypeScript frameworks: `express`, `fastify`, `nestjs`, `hono`, `koa`
   - Go frameworks: `gin`, `echo`, `fiber`, `chi`
   - Rust frameworks: `actix`, `axum`, `rocket`
   - Java frameworks: `spring`, `quarkus`, `micronaut`
   - PHP frameworks: `laravel`, `symfony`, `slim`, `lumen`
3. Extract `--ref` — resolve reference integration (priority order):
   - If `--ref` explicitly specified: use that
   - **If CWD is an existing integration repo** (e.g., in `django-apcore/`): use CWD repo as reference
   - Otherwise auto-detect: same-language integration preferred, fall back to any existing integration

Derive target repo name: `{framework}-apcore`
Derive target path: `{ecosystem_root}/{framework}-apcore/`

Display:
```
Integration Bootstrap:
  Framework:  {framework}
  Language:   {lang}
  Reference:  {ref-repo}
  Target:     {target-path}
```

---

### Step 2: Analyze Reference Integration (Sub-agent)

Spawn `generalist(subagent_type="general-purpose")`:

**Sub-agent prompt:**
```
Analyze the reference integration at {ref_path} to understand the pattern for apcore framework integrations.

read_file the following key files:
1. Main extension/app file (extension.py, apps.py, or module entry)
2. Config file (config.py, settings.py) — extract all APCORE_* settings
3. Scanner directory (scanners/) — how framework endpoints are discovered
4. Context mapping (context.py) — how request → apcore Context works
5. Registry (registry.py) — how modules are registered
6. CLI commands (cli.py, management/) — what commands are available
7. Output writers (output/) — how bindings are written
8. README.md — for user-facing documentation patterns
9. examples/ or demo/ — demo project structure

Return a structured analysis:

INTEGRATION_PATTERN:
  framework: {framework}
  language: {lang}
  version: {version}

EXTENSION_MECHANISM:
  How the integration hooks into the framework: {description}
  Entry point: {file and class/function}

CONFIGURATION:
  Settings prefix: APCORE_
  Settings count: {N}
  Key settings:
    - {SETTING_NAME}: {type} = {default} — {description}

SCANNER_PATTERN:
  Scanner types: {list of scanner variants, e.g., DRF, django-ninja}
  How endpoints are discovered: {description}
  How params are extracted: {description}

CONTEXT_MAPPING:
  How framework request → apcore Context: {description}
  Authentication extraction: {description}

CLI_COMMANDS:
  - {command}: {description}

DEMO_STRUCTURE:
  - {file}: {purpose}

Error handling:
- If the reference repo path does not exist, return: STATUS: NOT_FOUND, REASON: "Reference integration not found at {path}"
- If expected directories (scanners/, output/) are missing, note them and analyze what IS available
- If config file not found, note it and continue with partial analysis
- If README.md is missing, skip documentation pattern analysis

Keep summary to ~3-4KB.
```

Store as `ref_analysis`. If sub-agent returns STATUS: NOT_FOUND, use `ask_user` to provide a different reference or proceed without reference (scaffold from conventions only).

---

### Step 3: Framework-Specific Research

Use `ask_user` to gather framework-specific information:

- Question 1: "Which {framework} routing mechanism should the scanner target?"
  - Options based on framework (e.g., for FastAPI: "Path operations (Recommended)" / "APIRouter" / "Both")
- Question 2: "Which authentication patterns should context mapping support?"
  - Options: "Bearer token (Recommended)" / "Session-based" / "Both" / "Custom"
- Question 3 (if framework has multiple API styles): "Which API definition style?"
  - Options depend on framework

Store `framework_config`.

---

### Step 4: Scaffold Project (Sub-agent)

@../references/shared/conventions.md (refer to "Framework Integration structure" section)

Spawn `generalist(subagent_type="general-purpose")`:

**Sub-agent prompt:**
```
Create the project skeleton for {framework}-apcore at {target-path}.

Language: {lang}
Framework: {framework}
Reference pattern: {ref_analysis summary}
Framework config: {framework_config}

## Implementation Requirements

1. **extension.{ext}**: Framework plugin/extension class that:
   - Initializes apcore Registry on startup
   - Runs scanner to discover endpoints
   - Registers discovered modules

2. **config.{ext}**: Configuration class with ALL standard APCORE_* settings:
   APCORE_ENABLED (bool, True)
   APCORE_DEBUG (bool, False)
   APCORE_SCANNERS (list, ["auto"])
   APCORE_INCLUDE_PATHS (list, [])
   APCORE_EXCLUDE_PATHS (list, [])
   APCORE_MODULE_PREFIX (str, "")
   APCORE_AUTH_ENABLED (bool, False)
   APCORE_AUTH_STRATEGY (str, "bearer")
   APCORE_TRANSPORT (str, "stdio")
   APCORE_HOST (str, "0.0.0.0")
   APCORE_PORT (int, 8808)
   {Add framework-specific settings}

3. **scanners/{scanner}.{ext}**: Scanner that:
   - Walks framework route table
   - Extracts: path, method, params (name, type, required, default), description
   - Converts to apcore module definitions
   - Respects include/exclude path patterns

4. **context.{ext}**: Context factory that:
   - Maps framework request → apcore Context
   - Extracts auth info (Bearer token, session, etc.)
   - Handles async/sync appropriately

5. **cli.{ext}**: Commands:
   - `scan` — Discover endpoints and display/write bindings
   - `serve` — Start MCP server with discovered modules
   - `export` — Export to OpenAI tools JSON format

All files should have proper stubs with TODO markers for implementation.

Naming conventions:
- Python: snake_case for functions/methods, PascalCase for classes
- TypeScript: camelCase for functions/methods, PascalCase for classes
- Go: PascalCase for public, camelCase for private
- Rust: snake_case for functions/methods, PascalCase for types
- Java: camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes

Error handling:
- If {target-path} is not writable, return: STATUS: WRITE_ERROR, REASON: "{description}"
- If a file cannot be created, skip it and include in the return as "{file} (SKIPPED: {reason})"
- If the framework is not recognized, proceed with generic scaffold and note: "Unknown framework — used generic pattern"

Create ALL files listed. Return file list.
```

Verify after sub-agent:
- Build config exists
- At least scanner, config, extension, context, cli files exist
- Tests directory has test files
- Examples/demo directory exists

---

### Step 5: Generate Demo Project

If demo directory wasn't fully created by Step 4, create it:

write_file a minimal demo app that:
1. Creates a {framework} app with 3-5 sample CRUD endpoints
2. Integrates apcore via the extension
3. Includes `docker-compose.yml` with:
   - App service
   - Optional: MCP server service (using apcore-mcp)
4. Includes `README.md` with setup instructions

---

### Step 6: Generate Code-Forge Config and Feature Specs

write_file `.code-forge.json` and generate feature specs for code-forge planning.

Feature specs to generate (one per core capability):
1. `scanner.md` — Endpoint scanning for this framework
2. `config.md` — Configuration system
3. `context.md` — Request-to-context mapping
4. `registry.md` — Module registration
5. `cli.md` — CLI commands (scan, serve, export)
6. `observability.md` — Framework-specific tracing (optional)

Each feature spec MUST include:
- **Purpose** — what the feature does
- **Public API surface** — classes / functions / CLI commands introduced by this integration
- **Acceptance criteria**
- **One `## Contract: ClassName.method` block per public method** — per `shared/contract-spec.md`. The integration's public methods are scanner discovery entry points, config loader, context factory, CLI command entry points. Fill Contract fields from the reference integration (`{ref_path}`) where possible; mark the rest as `TODO`. **Never emit an empty Contract block** — if inference impossible, skip that method and surface as `"Contract skeleton deferred for {method} — fill by hand"` in the summary.
- **Core-SDK consumer contract** — for every call the integration makes into the core SDK (e.g., `Registry.register`, `Executor.execute`, `Context(...)`), cite the upstream `## Contract:` in `apcore/docs/features/*.md` and record which inputs / errors / properties the integration relies on. audit D10 uses this to verify the integration keeps using the core SDK correctly as the SDK evolves.

#### 6.1 Configuration Settings — Canonical Source

`config.md` feature spec and `src/{package}/config.{ext}` MUST source `APCORE_*` setting names / types / defaults from `shared/conventions.md` → "Required settings" list. Do NOT invent new settings inside an integration. If the framework genuinely requires a new setting:
1. Name it with the prefix `APCORE_{FRAMEWORK}_*` (e.g., `APCORE_FASTAPI_ROUTE_PREFIX`), not bare `APCORE_*`
2. Document the rationale in `docs/features/config.md` under a `### Framework-specific settings` section
3. File a PR against `shared/conventions.md` only if the setting is universally applicable

audit D7 flags any bare `APCORE_*` setting in an integration that is not in the canonical list.

Initialize git and create the skeleton commit automatically:

```bash
cd {target-path}
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize {framework}-apcore project skeleton"
```

Display:
```
Git initialized with skeleton commit.
```

## Coordination with Other Skills

- **After integration:** Use `code-forge:plan` per feature spec to plan implementation
- **During implementation:** Use `code-forge:impl` to execute TDD tasks
- **After each feature:** Use `code-forge:review` to review quality
- **Cross-integration consistency:** Use `apcore-skills:audit --scope integrations`
- **For release:** Use `apcore-skills:release` (integration versions are independent)
