# Code Forge — Worktree

## ⚡ Execution Entry Point (READ THIS FIRST)

**When this skill is loaded, you MUST immediately begin executing the Workflow below — do not wait, do not summarize, do not ask "what should I do now". Skills are operational manuals, not reference documents.** Read the first executable step, perform it, then the next, etc., until the workflow completes or you reach an `AskUserQuestion` checkpoint.

If the harness shows you `Successfully loaded skill · N tools allowed`, that message means **the SKILL.md content was injected into your context** — it does NOT mean the skill has run. Skills do not "run" autonomously; you run them by executing the Detailed Steps below.

If you find yourself about to say "the skill didn't produce output", "skill 仍未输出", "falling back to manual worktree setup", "回退到手动 worktree", or anything similar, **STOP**. You have misunderstood how skills work. Go directly to the first executable step and start.

The first user-visible action of this skill should be either (a) the output of the first step, or (b) an `AskUserQuestion` if the first step needs disambiguation. Never an apology, never a fallback, never silence.

Create an isolated git worktree for feature development with automated project setup and safety verification.

## When to Use

- Starting feature work that should not affect the main workspace
- Before running code-forge:impl to isolate implementation changes
- When you need a clean baseline for testing or experimentation

## Iron Law

**NEVER create a project-local worktree without verifying it is git-ignored.** Worktree contents tracked by git will cause repository corruption.

## Workflow

```
Detect Directory → Verify Safety → Create Worktree → Project Setup → Baseline Tests → Report
```

### Step 1: Detect Worktree Directory

Check in order:
1. Existing `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/` directory in project root — use if found
2. Project CLAUDE.md for worktree preference — use without asking
3. Ask user:
   - **Project-local** `.worktrees/` (Recommended) — keeps worktrees near the code
   - **Global** `~/.config/code-forge/worktrees/` — outside project, no .gitignore needed

### Step 2: Verify Safety (Project-Local Only)

**CRITICAL:** If using a project-local directory:

```bash
git check-ignore -q <worktree-dir>
```

- **Ignored:** Proceed
- **NOT ignored:** Add to `.gitignore` immediately, then commit:
  ```bash
  echo "<worktree-dir>/" >> .gitignore
  git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: add worktree directory to .gitignore"
  ```

Global directory: skip this step.

### Step 3: Create Worktree

```bash
# Detect project name
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")

# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add <worktree-dir>/<feature-name> -b <feature-name>
```

Branch naming: use the feature name provided by the user, prefixed with `feat/` if not already prefixed.

### Step 4: Project Setup

Auto-detect and run setup in the worktree directory:

| Marker | Command |
|--------|---------|
| `package.json` | `npm install` |
| `package-lock.json` | `npm ci` |
| `yarn.lock` | `yarn install` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `pnpm install` |
| `requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `pip install -e .` or `poetry install` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo fetch` |
| `go.mod` | `go mod download` |
| `build.gradle` | `./gradlew dependencies` |
| `pom.xml` | `mvn dependency:resolve` |

If multiple markers exist, run the most specific one. If none match, skip setup.

### Step 5: Baseline Tests

Run the project's test command to establish a clean baseline:

```bash
# Auto-detect test command from package.json, Makefile, etc.
# Run tests and report results
```

- **All pass:** Report green baseline, proceed
- **Some fail:** Warn user — "Baseline has N failing tests. These are pre-existing, not caused by your changes."
- **No test command found:** Skip, inform user

### Step 6: Report

```
Worktree created:
  Branch:    feat/<feature-name>
  Location:  <worktree-dir>/<feature-name>
  Setup:     npm install (completed)
  Baseline:  42/42 tests passing

Next steps (code-forge workflow):
  /code-forge:impl <feature-name>    Execute implementation tasks
  /code-forge:finish                  When done, merge/PR/cleanup

Next steps (ad-hoc development):
  /code-forge:tdd                    Enforce TDD discipline
  /code-forge:finish                  When done, merge/PR/cleanup
```

## Example

```
$ /code-forge:worktree user-auth

Worktree created:
  Branch:    feat/user-auth
  Location:  .worktrees/user-auth
  Setup:     npm ci (completed)
  Baseline:  42/42 tests passing

Next steps:
  /code-forge:impl user-auth    Execute implementation tasks
  /code-forge:finish             When done, merge/PR/cleanup
```

## Cleanup

To remove a stale worktree manually: `git worktree remove <path>`. List all worktrees with `git worktree list`. The `/code-forge:finish` skill handles cleanup automatically.

## Common Mistakes

- Creating project-local worktree without checking .gitignore
- Skipping baseline tests — pre-existing failures mask new regressions
- Hardcoding setup commands instead of auto-detecting
- Proceeding when baseline tests fail without user acknowledgment
