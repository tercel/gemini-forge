# GitHub PR Review Workflow

Post a 15-dimension code review directly to a GitHub Pull Request as a comment.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Current directory inside a git repository with a GitHub remote

## Workflow

```
Resolve PR → Fetch Diff → Detect Project Type → 14-Dimension Review (sub-agent) → Filter → Format → Post
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Resolve the Pull Request

Determine which PR to review:

1. **Explicit PR number** — user passed `--github-pr 123` or `--github-pr #123` → use that number
2. **No number** — auto-detect from current branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName,title,state --jq '.'
   ```
   - If no PR found: error — "No open PR found for the current branch. Specify a PR number: `/code-forge:review --github-pr 123`"
   - If PR is closed/merged: error — "PR #{number} is already {state}."
   - If PR is draft: warn but continue — "Note: PR #{number} is a draft."

Record: `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `head_branch`, `base_branch`, `pr_title`

### Step 2: Fetch PR Diff and Metadata

Run in parallel:

1. **Get the diff:**
   ```bash
   gh pr diff {pr_number}
   ```

2. **Get changed files list with full paths:**
   ```bash
   gh pr diff {pr_number} --name-only
   ```

3. **Get the HEAD commit full SHA** (for GitHub file links):
   ```bash
   gh pr view {pr_number} --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid'
   ```

4. **Get repository owner/name:**
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'
   ```

Record: `diff_content`, `changed_files`, `head_sha` (full 40-char), `repo_slug` (owner/name)

### Step 3: Detect Project Type

Same as the main review skill's project type detection (Step 3F.2 / 3P.2):
- Check changed files for frontend indicators (`.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, CSS)
- Check for backend indicators (server entries, API routes, DB models)
- Record: `project_type`

### Step 4: 15-Dimension Review (via Sub-agent)

Spawn an `generalist` sub-agent with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`.

**Sub-agent prompt must include:**

- PR title and number
- Base branch and head branch
- The full diff content
- List of changed files (sub-agent reads each file for full context)
- Detected project type
- **All 15 review dimensions** from the main SKILL.md's [Review Dimensions Reference]
- The 4-tier severity definitions (blocker / critical / warning / suggestion)
- **MANDATORY pre-analysis instruction:** *"Before applying any review dimension, read every changed file in full and build a call graph for every public method / exported function touched by the diff. Enumerate helpers called, validations performed, state mutations executed, errors raised, and external-input paths. Output as `METHOD_CHAINS` per `references/sub-agent-format.md`. Only after producing METHOD_CHAINS may you apply dimensions. Scope note: the graph is rooted at symbols MODIFIED by the diff — not every public symbol in every changed file. Do not trust method names or helper-function purity — open and read every callee. See the §Call-Graph Discipline section of the main review SKILL.md."*
- **MANDATORY post-analysis instruction (especially important for GitHub PR mode — speculative findings on a public PR damage trust more than no findings):** *"After applying dimensions and BEFORE writing any finding, route every candidate through §Finding Suppression Gate (Gates 1-4) in the main review SKILL.md. Drop speculative findings ('could theoretically', 'if X ever happens'). Drop D1/D2 findings whose input source is internal/trusted under the project's threat model. Downgrade design-preference 'critical' to `warning`. Accept empty dimensions. Every `critical`/`blocker` finding MUST include a non-empty `evidence` field showing concrete reachability. The PR will be visible to the team — be conservative."*
- Instruction: **"Review ONLY the changes in this PR diff. Do not flag pre-existing issues. For each issue, specify severity, file path, line number/range, title, description, and fix suggestion. When an issue was discovered via the call graph, reference the relevant METHOD_CHAINS entry. For critical/blocker findings, the `evidence` field must show: (a) concrete trigger input, (b) observable wrong behavior, (c) trust-boundary argument for D2 / defensive-gap findings."**

**Sub-agent must return the same structured format** as the main review skill (REVIEW_SUMMARY + per-dimension sections + **METHOD_CHAINS**). The orchestrator MUST verify METHOD_CHAINS is populated (covers every diff-modified public symbol) before posting to GitHub — a review posted to a public PR without the pre-analysis would be worse than no review because reviewers would wrongly trust its completeness. If the sub-agent fails the METHOD_CHAINS check twice, abort the post and surface the failure locally; do NOT post an incomplete review to the PR.

**Suppression-Gate validation (mandatory before posting to GitHub):** Apply the same five checks as the main review SKILL.md Step 4F:
1. **Evidence presence (critical/blocker)** — every critical/blocker requires non-empty `evidence`; reject and re-invoke; auto-downgrade after second failure.
2. **Speculative-phrase scan (ALL severities — DROP)** — drop every finding whose description matches the speculative tells (`could theoretically` / `if .* ever` / `in case someone` / `potentially might` / `non-deterministic` / `might be nicer` / `smells wrong` / `feels off`) at any severity. Do not downgrade-and-keep.
3. **Trust-boundary check (critical/blocker)** — auto-downgrade D2/defensive-gap critical/blocker findings whose evidence describes internal/trusted sources for `library`/`cli`/`unknown` project types. Skip for `frontend`/`backend`/`fullstack`.
4. **Warning-level observable-downside check (DROP)** — drop surviving warnings with no named observable downside (pure pattern/style divergence).
5. **Suggestion-level concrete-benefit check (DROP)** — drop surviving suggestions with no named concrete benefit.

**Public-PR specific cutoff:** if Report Health verdict (per SKILL.md §Report Health computation) contains any of the `gated` (auto-downgrade share > 30%), `noisy` (density > 2.0), or `fabricating` (drop share > 40%) flags — verdict is the comma-joined flag list, so check substring membership — **abort the GitHub post and surface locally instead** with the message: *"Review quality below public-PR threshold (verdict: {verdict}). Findings indicate quota-filling or systematic gate bypass. Posting to PR aborted to protect team trust. Run /code-forge:review --github-pr again after iterating on the underlying review skill, or post a manual review."* Posting low-quality reviews to public PRs is more damaging than not posting. (The `inflated` flag alone does NOT trigger abort — it indicates severity inflation but the underlying issues may still be real bugs the team should see; the auto-downgrade markers will already signal which were lowered. The `fabricating` flag is the strongest abort signal — a gate that had to drop >40% of findings means the remaining ones are also suspect.)

### Step 5: Filter Issues for GitHub

GitHub PR comments should be high-signal, not noisy. Apply filtering:

1. **Include:** All `blocker`, `critical`, and `warning` issues
2. **Exclude:** `suggestion` severity (these are nice-to-have and create noise on PRs)
3. **Exclude:** Issues on lines NOT changed in this PR (pre-existing issues)
4. If zero issues remain after filtering → post the "no issues" comment (Step 6.2)

### Step 6: Format and Post

#### 6.1 Issues Found

Format the comment body:

```markdown

```bash
gh pr comment {pr_number} --body "$(cat <<'REVIEW_EOF'
{formatted_comment}
REVIEW_EOF
)"
```

### Step 7: Terminal Summary

## Error Handling

- **`gh` not installed:** "Error: `gh` CLI not found. Install it: https://cli.github.com/"
- **Not authenticated:** "Error: `gh` not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` first."
- **No GitHub remote:** "Error: No GitHub remote found in this repository."
- **PR not found:** "Error: PR #{number} not found. Check the number and try again."
- **Comment post fails:** Show the formatted comment in the terminal as fallback and display the `gh` error.
