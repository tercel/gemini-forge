# Sub-agent Response Format

The review sub-agent must return results in the following structured YAML format.

**Note:** Feature mode and Project mode have slightly different fields in `REVIEW_SUMMARY` and the final consistency section. See the mode-specific notes below.

**`METHOD_CHAINS` is MANDATORY and comes first — the orchestrator rejects any response without it.** See the `references/review/call-graph-discipline.md` (full protocol including anti-rationalization guard) for the protocol. The sub-agent must produce one `METHOD_CHAINS` entry per public method / exported function / entry-point in the reviewed scope, then apply dimensions against the graph, not against surface method bodies.

**`CANDIDATE_INVENTORY` is MANDATORY and comes BETWEEN `METHOD_CHAINS` and the dimension blocks.** This is the pre-emission scratchpad: every candidate finding discovered during dimension application must appear here with an explicit `KEEP` or `DROP` decision and a fixed-enum `decision_reason` code. This enforces the Anthropic pre-emission-CoT pattern — the sub-agent makes the keep/drop judgment *before* writing the dimension blocks, not as a post-hoc filter. See `references/review/suppression-gates.md` §Drop Gallery for the concrete examples each DROP code corresponds to, and see §Pre-emission Scratchpad below for the full schema.

**`evidence` field is MANDATORY for every `critical` and `blocker` finding.** See `references/review/suppression-gates.md`. The orchestrator rejects critical/blocker findings missing `evidence` and (after one re-invoke) auto-downgrades them with a `[Auto-downgraded: missing evidence]` marker. `evidence` SHOULD be present for `warning` findings when non-obvious; OPTIONAL for `suggestion`. The field must show: (a) the concrete input/condition that triggers the failure, (b) the observable wrong behavior, and (c) for D2 / D1-defensive-gap findings, the trust-boundary argument per Gate 2.

**`evidence` is ALSO MANDATORY at any severity (including `warning` and `suggestion`) when the finding makes a falsifiable factual claim about the codebase** — Gate 5 in `references/review/suppression-gates.md`. Trigger phrases: `zero references`, `zero reads`, `never called`, `never read`, `dead code`, `unreachable`, `unused`, `only used in`, `only referenced in`, `sole consumer`, `duplicates X`, `copy of`, `redeclares`, `parallel implementation`, `reimplements`, `grep (returns|shows|finds)`, `N lines exceed`, `exceeds N lines`. When any of these appear in `title` / `description`, `evidence` MUST include:

- **Option A — command + output:** The full `grep` / `rg` / search command that was actually run, AND one or more lines of its matched output (in `path:line:content` format), OR the explicit string `0 matches` / `no matches` when claiming absence. A single-sentence summary (*"grep returns only the declaration"*) is NOT sufficient — the raw output itself must be visible.
- **Option B — file:line citations:** Explicit `path/to/file.ext:LINE` references covering every site the claim depends on. A "duplicates Y" claim must cite both the original and the duplicate. An "only used in foo.ts" claim must cite foo.ts AND carry a grep proving no other uses. A "dead code" claim requires cross-directory coverage (src + tests at minimum).

Example (warning-level factual claim) — **acceptable**:
```yaml
evidence: |
  grep -rn "ERROR_CODE_MAP" src/ tests/
  src/main.ts:111:const ERROR_CODE_MAP: Record<string, number> = {
  src/main.ts:1129:    const exitCode = errorCode && errorCode in ERROR_CODE_MAP
  src/main.ts:1130:      ? ERROR_CODE_MAP[errorCode]
  → 2 read sites in same file as declaration; overlaps with errors.ts:135 codeMap
    (which has these entries too: MODULE_NOT_FOUND, SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR, APPROVAL_DENIED).
  Proposed: consolidate readers to codeMap, delete main.ts:111-134.
```

Example (warning-level factual claim) — **rejected by Gate 5**:
```yaml
evidence: "grep returns only the declaration; zero reads."
```
The second example is rejected because the grep *output* is not visible — only a paraphrase. The sub-agent may have mis-read the output or greppped too narrow a scope; without the actual matched lines in evidence, the orchestrator cannot distinguish a true zero-reference claim from a false one.

## Pre-emission Scratchpad (`CANDIDATE_INVENTORY`)

Every candidate finding discovered while applying dimensions MUST appear in `CANDIDATE_INVENTORY` with an explicit `KEEP` or `DROP` decision BEFORE it appears (or doesn't) in a dimension block. This is the Anthropic pre-emission-CoT pattern: force the keep/drop decision with justification up front, rather than writing all findings into dimension blocks and hoping a post-hoc gate catches the noise.

**Rules:**
1. Every candidate — whether you intend to KEEP or DROP it — must have a row in `CANDIDATE_INVENTORY`.
2. `decision_reason` MUST be one of the fixed enum values below. Free-text reasons are rejected by the orchestrator (see SKILL.md Step 4F/4P scratchpad audit).
3. For every KEEP candidate, exactly one dimension block must contain a matching issue (same `file:line` + `title`). Orchestrator cross-checks.
4. For every DROP candidate, NO dimension block may contain a matching issue. Orchestrator cross-checks — attempting to DROP in the scratchpad but KEEP in dimensions is flagged as a bypass attempt and the finding is rejected outright.
5. If dimensions were truly empty, the inventory may be empty — but empty inventory + any finding in dimension blocks is rejected.

**KEEP reason codes (enum):**

| Code | When to use |
|---|---|
| `concrete_bug_reachable` | Concrete input triggers observable wrong behavior (D1/D3/D6/D8). |
| `cross_module_drift_observable` | Sibling modules with symmetric contract diverge in observable behavior — e.g. module A has guard/audit/approval, module B does not; module A coerces input, module B does not. Requires contract-symmetry pre-flight (see §CROSS_MODULE_CONSISTENCY). |
| `factual_claim_verified_with_grep` | "Zero references" / "dead code" / "duplicates" claim with actual `grep`/`rg` command + output in `evidence`. |
| `consolidation_3plus_sites_verified` | ≥3 sites of real duplication verified with grep output; extraction target exists or benefit is named concretely. |
| `critical_path_untested` | D7 — a path with observable failure mode has no test coverage (requires naming the failure mode). |
| `plan_criterion_unmet` | An acceptance criterion from `plan.md` is not met in the code. |

**DROP reason codes (enum):**

| Code | Canonical trigger |
|---|---|
| `extract_helper_under_3_sites` | Duplicate appears in only 2 sites. |
| `refactor_preference_no_bug` | Fix introduces a new abstraction replacing a working pattern; no observed bug. |
| `documented_known_gap` | Description self-identifies as already-tracked (CLAUDE.md, TODO, next release). |
| `self_admitted_low_value` | "impact is small", "only worth if X surfaces", "edge case", "theoretical concern". |
| `pure_symmetry_no_bug` | "Inconsistent with sibling" with no named caller consequence. |
| `rename_for_clarity_no_ambiguity` | Rename without concrete past-confusion incident or mis-describing name. |
| `speculative_phrasing` | Description contains "could theoretically", "if X ever happens", "in case someone", "potentially might". |
| `trust_boundary_internal` | D1/D2 finding on developer-authored / type-checked / internal input source. |
| `unverified_factual_claim` | Gate 5 trigger phrase ("zero references", "dead code", "only used in") without grep output or file:line evidence. |
| `defensive_hardening_speculative` | Runtime check against an input source that is developer-controlled. |
| `typo_hypothetical` | "A typo WOULD no-op" — the typo doesn't exist in the code. |
| `packaging_naming_out_of_scope` | Binary-name collision / npm-scope / bin-script rename when review scope doesn't include packaging. |
| `style_swap_no_downside` | "Prefer X over Y" / "consider using X instead" without a named downside of Y. |
| `formatting_casing_linter_territory` | Whitespace, camelCase vs snake_case, `WARNING:` vs `Warning:` — linter concern, not review. |

**Scratchpad schema:**

```
CANDIDATE_INVENTORY:
- id: C1
  dimension: <D1 | D2 | D3 | ... | D15>
  file: path/to/file.ext
  line: <number or range>
  title: <short title — must match the title in the dimension block if decision=KEEP>
  decision: <KEEP | DROP>
  decision_reason: <one of the enum codes above — NO free text>
  decision_detail: <one line — why THIS code applies to THIS candidate, e.g.
                   "2 sites (main.ts:937 and :982), below 3-site threshold">
- id: C2
  ...
```

**Example inventory (hypothetical review with 6 candidates):**

```
CANDIDATE_INVENTORY:
- id: C1
  dimension: D1
  file: src/discovery.ts
  line: 289
  title: "apcli exec bypasses checkApproval and audit-log writes"
  decision: KEEP
  decision_reason: cross_module_drift_observable
  decision_detail: "discovery.ts:289 invokes executor.execute directly; main.ts:1038 wires approval+audit for buildModuleCommand with symmetric contract"
- id: C2
  dimension: D4
  file: src/main.ts
  line: 937
  title: "reserved-set redeclared at two sites"
  decision: DROP
  decision_reason: extract_helper_under_3_sites
  decision_detail: "appears at main.ts:937 and main.ts:982 — 2 sites, below 3-site threshold"
- id: C3
  dimension: D4
  file: src/cli.ts
  line: 17
  title: "Local Registry placeholders diverge from upstream apcore-js"
  decision: DROP
  decision_reason: documented_known_gap
  decision_detail: "description itself references CLAUDE.md tracking and next apcore-js compatibility bump"
- id: C4
  dimension: D4
  file: src/output.ts
  line: 39
  title: "truncate slices on UTF-16 code units"
  decision: DROP
  decision_reason: self_admitted_low_value
  decision_detail: "suggestion text includes 'behavioral impact is small; only worth doing if broken-glyph reports surface'"
- id: C5
  dimension: D4
  file: src/main.ts
  line: 403
  title: "_exposureFilter attached via as unknown as Record cast"
  decision: DROP
  decision_reason: refactor_preference_no_bug
  decision_detail: "fix introduces ProgramMeta interface; no observed typo or runtime bug — 'a typo WOULD no-op' is hypothetical"
- id: C6
  dimension: D15
  file: src/system-cmd.ts
  line: 207
  title: "emitResult helper re-implemented in 5 registrars"
  decision: KEEP
  decision_reason: consolidation_3plus_sites_verified
  decision_detail: "grep -n 'fmt === \"json\"' yields 5 inline sites + 1 helper; concrete maintenance cost named"
```

In the above, only C1 and C6 appear in dimension blocks. C2–C5 never leave the scratchpad. The orchestrator audits both directions: KEEP candidates must appear in dimensions, DROP candidates must not.

    #                                                                            inlined body using "  helper →" prefix

    #   validate: <condition>         — early-return / raise / assert guard
    #   mutate: <target>              — write to state (self.x, map insert, event emit, lock acquire, I/O)
    #   raise: <ErrorType>            — error raised / thrown / returned-as-Err
    #   iterate: <source>             — iteration over external input (argument, deserialized data, plugin output)
    #   subscript: <source>           — indexing/key-access into external input

    #   return: <value>               — explicit return statement (useful to mark exit paths)
    #   lock: <target>                — lock acquire (a specialization of `mutate` when a RLock/Mutex is the subject)
    #   yield: <value>                — generator yield (context manager __enter__/__exit__ boundaries)
    #
    # THREE-TIER INLINING CONVENTION (per `call-graph-discipline.md`):
    # Tier 1 — same-module private helper: follow `call` with full recursive inlining, "  helper →" prefix.
    #          Two-level nesting: "    HELPER_A → HELPER_B → step" (additional indent per depth).
    # Tier 2 — cross-module callee ALSO in the review scope: follow `call` with DEPTH-1 inlining (top-level
    #          body only, do not recurse deeper), "  X:Module.method →" prefix. The `X:` marker signals the
    #          cross-module boundary crossing.
    #
    #     # Tier 1 example (same-module private helper):
    #     - { kind: call,      detail: "_discover_custom(rootPaths)",                                   line: 257 }

    #     - { kind: subscript, detail: "  _discover_custom → entry['module_id'] (unguarded)",           line: 269 }
    #     - { kind: raise,     detail: "  _discover_custom → KeyError uncaught, aborts whole loop",     line: 269 }
    #
    #     # Tier 2 example (cross-module callee in diff, depth-1):
    #     - { kind: call,      detail: "DisplayResolver.resolve(node)",                                 line: 45 }
    #     - { kind: call,      detail: "  X:DisplayResolver.resolve → for surface in node.surfaces",    line: 78 }
    #     - { kind: subscript, detail: "  X:DisplayResolver.resolve → surface['values']  (unguarded)",  line: 82 }
    #     - { kind: raise,     detail: "  X:DisplayResolver.resolve → TypeError if not dict",           line: 85 }
    #     - { kind: ext_call,  detail: "  X:DisplayResolver.resolve → _apply_coerce(surface) [tier3]",  line: 90 }

## Per-Module Sub-agent Format

Used by each parallel per-module agent in the layered review path (3F.4b / 3P.3b). Contains intra-module dimensions only — D5, D7, D10-D15 are deferred to the cross-module agent.

```
MODULE_REVIEW_SCOPE:
  group_id: <string — e.g. "src/binding", "serializers">
  primary_files: [<file paths reviewed in full by this agent — same as input>]
  tier2_files: [<subset of input `in_diff_files` that this agent actually opened for depth-1 cross-module expansion; files never touched during chain-building are NOT listed here even if they were in in_diff_files>]

METHOD_CHAINS:
# Scope: public symbols in this module group's PRIMARY files only (tier-2 files' symbols
# are NOT top-level entries — they appear only as inlined steps inside primary-module chains).
# Three-tier inlining per `call-graph-discipline.md`:
#   Tier 1 (same-module private helpers)     → full recursive inlining, "  helper →" prefix
#   Tier 2 (cross-module callees in diff)    → depth-1 inlining,        "  X:Module.method →" prefix
#   Tier 3 (stdlib, third-party, not in diff) → ext_call leaf, no expansion
# Test files are exempt.
- symbol: <ClassName.method_name | function_name>
  file: <path — must be one of primary_files>
  line: <number>
  purpose: <one-line purpose>
  chain: [... steps per three-tier inlining convention ...]
  chain_completeness: <matches_purpose | partial | suspicious>
  gaps: [...]
  external_inputs:
  # external_inputs[].via values:
  #   "direct"              — iterate/subscript happens in the public method's own body
  #   "<helper_name>"       — happens inside a tier-1 inlined private helper
  #   "X:<Module.method>"   — happens inside a tier-2 inlined cross-module callee
  - { source: <name>, guarded: <true | false>, guard_detail: "<...>", via: "<direct | helper_name | X:Module.method>" }
  tier2_callees:
  # Every tier-2 cross-module callee inlined in this chain — lets the orchestrator cross-check
  # coverage and deduplicate issues that also get flagged by the agent owning the callee's module.
  - callee: <Module.method>
    callee_file: <path>
    lines_referenced: [<line numbers in callee_file that were inlined>]

## Cross-Module Sub-agent Format

Used by the single cross-module aggregation agent in the layered review path (3F.5 / 3P.4). Receives all per-module METHOD_CHAINS. Applies cross-cutting dimensions and consistency checks.

    evidence: <MANDATORY AT ANY SEVERITY for D15 — every D15 finding asserts a Gate 5 factual claim (dead code, duplicate, parallel implementation, scope creep, unused, only-used-in-X). Evidence MUST paste the actual `grep -rn` / `rg` command AND its matched-line output covering at least `src/` + `tests/` for dead-code claims, OR cite both sides with file:line for duplicate / parallel claims. A narrative summary like "grep returns only the declaration" is insufficient — orchestrator Step 4F validation #4b drops D15 findings lacking the command+output or file:line citations.>
