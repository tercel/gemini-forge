# Code Forge — Status

## ⚡ Execution Entry Point (READ THIS FIRST)

**When this skill is loaded, you MUST immediately begin executing the Workflow below — do not wait, do not summarize, do not ask "what should I do now". Skills are operational manuals, not reference documents.** Read the first executable step, perform it, then the next, etc., until the workflow completes or you reach an `AskUserQuestion` checkpoint.

If the harness shows you `Successfully loaded skill · N tools allowed`, that message means **the SKILL.md content was injected into your context** — it does NOT mean the skill has run. Skills do not "run" autonomously; you run them by executing the Detailed Steps below.

If you find yourself about to say "the skill didn't produce output", "skill 仍未输出", "falling back to manual status check", "回退到手动 status", or anything similar, **STOP**. You have misunderstood how skills work. Go directly to the first executable step and start.

The first user-visible action of this skill should be either (a) the output of the first step (i.e., the dashboard or detailed status), or (b) an `AskUserQuestion` if the first step needs disambiguation. Never an apology, never a fallback, never silence.

Display a dashboard of all features or detailed progress for a specific feature.

## When to Use

- Want to see all features and their progress
- Want to check status of a specific feature
- Need to regenerate the project-level overview

## Examples

```bash
/code-forge:status                  # Show project dashboard
/code-forge:status user-auth        # Show detail for one feature
```

## Workflow

```
Load Config → Scan Features → Display Dashboard or Detail → Update Overview
```

## Detailed Steps

@../shared/configuration.md

---

### Step 1: Determine Mode

Based on arguments:
- **No argument** → Global Dashboard (Step 2)
- **Feature name provided** → Feature Detail (Step 3)

---

### Step 2: Global Dashboard

#### 2.1 Scan for Features

1. Resolve the output directory: `<base_dir>/<output_dir>/`
2. Search for all `state.json` files in **both** locations:
   - `<output_dir>/*/state.json` (standard plans)
   - `.code-forge/tmp/*/state.json` (temporary plans created with `--tmp`)
3. For each `state.json`, extract: `feature`, `status`, `progress.*`, `metadata.source_doc`, `updated`
4. Mark features from `.code-forge/tmp/` with `[tmp]` suffix in display

#### 2.2 Display Feature Dashboard

**Features found:** Show table with #, Feature, Progress, Status, Last Updated.

```
code-forge — Feature Dashboard

  #  | Feature        | Progress   | Status      | Last Updated
  1  | user-auth      | 3/5 (60%)  | in_progress | 2026-02-14
  2  | file-upload    | 0/3 (0%)   | pending     | 2026-02-13
  3  | notifications  | 4/4 (100%) | completed   | 2026-02-12

Commands:
  /code-forge:plan @doc.md          Create new plan from document
  /code-forge:plan "requirement"    Create new plan from prompt
  /code-forge:impl <feature>        Execute tasks for a feature
  /code-forge:status <feature>      View feature detail
  /code-forge:fix "description"  Debug a bug
  /code-forge:review <feature>      Review completed feature
```

Offer actions via `AskUserQuestion`:
- Enter a feature name to view its detail
- Start a new plan
- Exit

**No features found:** Show empty state with instructions:
- How to create a feature document at `{base_dir}/{input_dir}/{feature-name}.md`
- How to run `/code-forge:plan @path/to/feature.md` or `/code-forge:plan "requirement text"`

#### 2.3 Update Project-Level Overview

After scanning, regenerate `{output_dir}/overview.md` using Step 4 logic.

#### 2.4 Handle User Selection

- **Feature name selected** → show Feature Detail (Step 3)
- **"New plan"** → suggest `/code-forge:plan` command
- **"Exit"** → end

---

### Step 3: Feature Detail

#### 3.1 Locate Feature

1. Look for `{output_dir}/{feature_name}/state.json`
2. If not found, also check `.code-forge/tmp/{feature_name}/state.json`
3. If still not found: show error, list available features

#### 3.2 Display Feature Detail

Read `state.json` and display:

```

### Step 4: Generate/Update Project-Level Overview

@../shared/overview-generation.md

Display: `Project overview updated: {output_dir}/overview.md`
